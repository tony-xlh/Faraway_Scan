# Faraway Scan

Barcode Scanner which is designed for scanning from far away.

## Ways to Read Barcode in a Long Distance

1. Use the camera's zoom-in feature.
2. Take a photo instead of directly doing a live scan. The highest video stream resolution of mobile cameras may range from HD to 4K. Taking a photo will produce an image with a much higher resolution.
3. Use super resolution deep learning models.
